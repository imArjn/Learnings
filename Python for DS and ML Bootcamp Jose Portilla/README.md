# ðŸ§  Python for Data Science and Machine Learning â€“ Jose Portilla

This folder contains my hands-on notes, exercises, and projects from the Udemy course:  
**"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla.**

Iâ€™m using this as a foundational stepping stone into ML and data science. Each notebook is organized by section/topic from the course.
